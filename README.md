# Schedule Prospector Windows App


Schedule Prospector is a free Scheduling tool. It can
help you automate tedious and repetitive tasks such as DCMA 14-Point Assessment,
Reports Graphs, and more!

Schedule Prospector is currently in beta release. I’m doing my best to make it the best scheduler assistant tool and always FREE.

Currently, Schedule Prospector supports only Primavera P6 schedules in XER file format, but there’s a plan to implement other tools and files formats in the future.
